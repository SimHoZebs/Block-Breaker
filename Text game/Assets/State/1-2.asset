  storyText: 'I throw my arms behind me and grab my buttcheeks.

    "Thank god they
    are still intact."

    With a sigh of relief, I notice something weird about
    the buttcheeks.

    I pat around the cheeks.

    I don''t have a buttcrack.

    I
    don''t have an asshole.

    These aren''t buttcheeks. This is one whole buttcheek.'
